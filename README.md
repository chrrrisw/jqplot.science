jqplot.science
==============

Extensions to jqplot to support interactive scientific plotting

Installation
============

Place jqplot.science somewhere in your static path.  You will also need
jqplot and jquery.  The examples expect that jquery.min.js and jqplot
are in the same directory as jqplot.science.  Simlinks work pretty well
for this.
